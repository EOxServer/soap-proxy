    <!-- 
         The following parameters are used to configure soap_proxy:
           BackendURL, MapFile, MapServ, DeleteNonSoapURLs, SOAPOperationsURL
         They may be defined globally in ../../axis2.xml instead of here.
         At least one of BackendURL or MapServ is required to be
         correctly configured.  If BackendURL is defined, then MapServ is
         ignored.  This means if you wish to use MapServ you must delete or
         comment out the BackendURL parameter.
         If MapServ is used, then MapFile must also be defined.
         In case of BackendURL we don't know if the backend is a mapserver
         or an eoxserver instance, so MapFile is not mandatory - but beware
         that things will fail downstream if the user attempts to send
         requests to mapserver without a mapfile, even via a BackendURL.

         be deleted from the response by the soap proxy if you do not wish to
         advertise the availability of the non-SOAP interface. 
         Set DeleteNonSoapURLs to true to delete the original GET and POST
         URLs for non-SOAP access.

         where the service should be accessed from the outside.
         Use SOAPOperationsURL to set this URL explicitly.
         If undefined then soap_proxy uses the URL where it is invoked.

    <description>
       This proxy service accepts O3S WCS 2.0 SOAP requests, optionally with
       the Earth Observation Application Profile, and invokes a corresponding
       POST operation on a connected mapserver or EOxServer.
       The operation GetMsVersion is a debugging information operation for
       this service, and is not a O3S WCS operation.  It reports the version
       of the mapserver connected this service. It may not be available in all
       configurations.
