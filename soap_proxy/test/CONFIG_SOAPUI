SOAPUI Config guide for eoxserver
----------------------------------

This guide describes how to set up soapui to work with local schema
definitions.
We use apache httpd as a local proxy to access the local xsd files.

CAUTION:
-------
Be very careful in setting up apache as a proxy server.  If in doubt about
deviating from these instructions and in particular about enabling
ProxyRequests, be sure to study the apache httpd documentation in detail.

ProxyRequests should be kept turned Off.


1. Setting up Apache httpd.
----------------------------

1a. configure a local soapuiproxy alias for localhost in /etc/hosts.
  --> simply add soapuiproxy as another alias on the line for 127.0.0.1

1b. set up a virtual server for soapuiproxy for httpd:
  cd <apache config root>   # on my OpenSuse this is /etc/apache2
  --> add the folling line in listen.conf:
     NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8822

  cd vhosts.d
  copy TEMPLATE_soapuiproxy.conf to this dir as 'soapuiproxy.conf', and in the
  file edit the paths to the local schema directory (all strings starting with
  '/path/to/..').
  

2. Setting up soapui to use apache httpd.
