SOAPUI Config guide for eoxserver
----------------------------------

This guide describes how to set up soapui to work with local schema
definitions.
We use apache httpd as a local proxy to access the local xsd files.

CAUTION:
-------
Be very careful in setting up apache as a proxy server.  If in doubt about
deviating from these instructions and in particular about enabling
ProxyRequests, be sure to study the apache httpd documentaion in detail.

ProxyRequests should be ketp turned Off.


1. Setting up Apache httpd.
----------------------------

1a. configure a local soapuiproxy alias for localhost in /etc/hosts.
  --> simpoly add soapuiproxy as another alias on the line for 127.0.0.1

1b. set up a virtual server for soapuiproxy for httpd:
  cd <apache config root>   # on my OpenSuse this is /etc/apache2
  --> add the folling line in listen.conf:
     NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8881

  cd vhosts.d
  copy TEMPLATE_soapuiproxy.conf to this dir, and edit the paths to the local
  schema directory.  
  

2. Setting up soapui to use apache httpd.
