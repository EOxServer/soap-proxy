This directory contains specs and sources for the rpmbuilds.
The sources that may be obtained on-line or elsewhere in the eoxserver svn tree
are not included here; only additional sources not easily accessible and needed
for the builds are included in the SOURCES directory.

To install soap_proxy, first install axis2c_eo, and then eo_soap_proxy.

To build eo_soap_proxy.rpm:
  1. prepare the source from 'upstream':
      svn co http://eoxserver.org/svn/trunk/soap_proxy
      mv soap_proxy eo_soap_proxy-1.0.0
      tar --exclude-vcs --exclude=eo_soap_proxy-1.0.0/test \
        -czf eo_soap_proxy-1.0.0.tgz eo_soap_proxy-1.0.0

  2. copy eo_soap_proxy.spec into ~/rpmbuild/SPECS,
     and copy eo_soap_proxy-1.0.0.tgz into ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

  3. build:
     cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
     rpmbuild -ba eo_soap_proxy.spec
